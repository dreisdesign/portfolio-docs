All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.5.24] - 2025-08-12 - Modular Media Zoom System & Carousel Icon Integration

### Added
- **Modular Overlay Core**: Introduced `zoom-overlay-core.js` as a unified accessible overlay foundation (focus trap, ESC handling, scroll lock) consumed by both image and video zoom modules.
- **Video Zoom Parity**: New `zoom-video.js` delivers feature parity with image zoom (enlarged playback, placeholder fade-in, auto-play) by cloning `<source>` elements for clean playback state.
- **Dynamic Lifecycle Binding**: MutationObserver + custom events (`protectedContentUnlocked`, `carouselsInitialized`) ensure images/videos added after initial load (carousel initialization, password unlock) are seamlessly bound without duplicates (dataset guard flags).

### Changed
- **Image Zoom Refactor**: `zoomable-image.js` updated to consume overlay core; removed legacy inline overlay logic from password-protection template.
- **Password-Protected Page Parity**: Forced script injection guarantees zoom + carousel scripts load inside protected builds; event dispatch after unlock triggers re-binding.
- **Carousel Navigation**: Replaced textual prev/next controls with inline currentColor SVG arrow icons; vertically centered buttons and standardized sizing.
- **Scoped SVG Override**: Added `.carousel .carousel-button svg { width:24px; height:auto; }` in `feature-carousel.css` to neutralize broad global `.content svg` rule that previously distorted navigation icons.
- **Logging Reduction**: Carousel verbose logs routed through a `carouselDebug` helper gated by `window.CAROUSEL_DEBUG`.

### Removed
- **Redundant Post-Unlock Zoom Tagging**: Eliminated duplicate video tagging loop in password template (single tagging + event now sufficient).

### Fixed
- **Missed Video Zoom on Protected Pages**: Videos now reliably open in overlay after unlock (binding no longer races original DOM insert).
- **Icon Mis-Sizing**: Carousel arrows no longer inherit unintended width/height from global SVG rule.

### Technical Implementation
- Shared overlay factory returns overlay root & close logic reused by both modules.
- Video zoom uses optimistic reveal with timeout safety net and progressive preload via IntersectionObserver.
- Dataset idempotency flags prevent re-binding during rapid DOM mutations.
- Event-driven architecture avoids brittle polling and keeps feature JS lean.

### Impact
- **Consistency**: Images and videos present a unified zoom experience (public + protected pages, inside carousels).
- **Maintainability**: Overlay behavior centralized; future media types can adopt same core.
- **Performance**: Lazy binding & conditional preload minimize network use while keeping interactions instant.
- **DX**: Cleaner template and quieter console.

### Migration Notes
No action required. Existing pages gain video zoom automatically after rebuild. Enable debug with `window.CAROUSEL_DEBUG = true`.

## [2.5.23] - 2025-08-12 - Refined Git Image Change Detection (Script v2.0.1)

### Changed
- **Image Processing Default Behavior**: Git-based image pipeline now ignores the previous commit diff (`HEAD~1..HEAD`) by default, preventing recently committed images from being repeatedly reprocessed on every subsequent build.
- **Detection Scope**: Now only processes images that are (a) unstaged working tree changes, (b) staged/index changes, (c) missing any responsive/zoom outputs (selfâ€‘healing), or (d) explicitly forced.
- **Logging Clarity**: Updated logging to clearly show whether last commit changes are included.

### Added
- **`--include-last-commit` Flag**: Opt-in flag to restore prior behavior of also processing images changed in the most recent commit.
- **Documentation**: README updated to reflect new flags and refined detection model.

### Unchanged
- **Force Mode**: `--force-all` still processes every image (e.g., for baseline regeneration).
- **Self-Healing**: Missing variant or zoom files still trigger regeneration automatically.

### Impact
- **Faster Repeat Builds**: Avoids unnecessary reprocessing after committing large image batches.
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Builds are stable across runs until new modifications occur or variants go missing.

### Migration Notes
No action required. Existing workflows continue to work. Use `--include-last-commit` if you depended on the old behavior for post-commit verification builds.

## [2.5.22] - 2025-08-11 - Comprehensive Lock Icon System for Password-Protected Portfolio Cards

### Added
- **Visual Lock Icon System**: Complete implementation of lock icons for password-protected portfolio cards across all portfolio locations
  - **Portfolio Index Page**: Lock icons appear on password-protected cards with white color on dark background overlay
  - **Up Next Cards**: Lock icons displayed on password-protected projects in "Up Next" sections at bottom of portfolio pages

  - **Next Project Mapping Fix**: Corrected "Up Next" card generation to include password protection status from portfolio data

### Enhanced
- **Build Pipeline Integration**: Lock icon generation fully integrated into portfolio build process
  - **Step Integration**: Lock icon injection added to portfolio build pipeline after tag processing

  - **Result**: Lock icons now properly inherit white color from parent `.card--lock-icon` CSS styling
- **Up Next Card Data Flow**: Fixed missing password protection data in "Up Next" card generation
  - **Root Cause**: `createNextProjectMap()` function was not including `isPasswordProtected` property from portfolio metadata

## [2.5.15] - 2025-07-07 - NPM Script & Interactive Menu Restructuring

### Changed

  - Renamed `preview` â†’ `build` (build + preview server - most common workflow)
  - `npm start` now only starts preview server on existing build
- **Interactive Menu Updates**: Updated menu commands to match new npm script structure
  - "Build" â†’ "Build & Preview" (runs `npm run build`)
  - "Preview" â†’ "Start Server" (runs `npm start`)
  - Moved advanced audit build to "Swift Build + Audit" in Utilities submenu
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `README.md` to reflect new command structure

### Benefits
- Clearer separation between build-only and build-with-preview workflows
- More intuitive menu naming that matches actual functionality
- Consistent command patterns across the project

## [2.5.14] - 2025-07-02 - Automated Version Token Replacement

### Added
- **Automated `{{VERSION}}` Replacement**: The build script now automatically replaces all `{{VERSION}}` tokens in HTML output with the version from `package.json` after all other build steps. This ensures correct cache-busting and versioning for all assets, including the homepage.

## [2.5.13] - 2025-07-02 - Modular Carousel & "Up Next" Card Refactor

### Changed
- **Carousel Generation**: Refactored carousel generation in `06-build-portfolio.mjs` to be 100% template-driven, using the new `carousel-template.html`. All hardcoded carousel HTML has been removed from the script.
- **"Up Next" Card Generation**: Refactored the "Up Next" card generation to use the `up-next-card-template.html`. The script now injects data into the template, rather than building the HTML from strings.
- **Maintainability**: This change makes both the carousel and "Up Next" card components easier to maintain and update, as their structure is now defined in clean HTML templates instead of being embedded in JavaScript.

## [2.5.12] - 2025-07-02 - Modular Head Injection Refactor

### Changed
- Refactored the build pipeline to use a modular, template-driven head injection system.
- The HTML head is now split into upper and lower parts, managed in `injected-head-upper.html` and `injected-head-lower.html`.
- New scripts `inject-head-upper.mjs` and `inject-head-lower.mjs` inject these templates at the `<!-- BUILD_INSERT id="head-upper" -->` and `<!-- BUILD_INSERT id="head-lower" -->` placeholders in all HTML files in the build output.
- Dynamic versioning, CSS suffix, and portfolio-specific scripts are handled in the lower head injection.
- Documentation and build scripts updated to reflect the new modular approach.
- Fixed build path issues in injection scripts to ensure correct operation.
