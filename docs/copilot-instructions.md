# Prompt Style Guidelines

## Emoji System for AI Responses

Use these at the start of each AI response for clarity:

- ‚úÖ = complete/success
- ‚ö†Ô∏è = issue/warning
- üí¨ = options/clarification
- üöß = in progress
- üîç = searching/auditing
- üìù = doc/note
- üü¢ = ready/green-light

## Response Style
- Use plain, simple language
- Be concise (e.g., say ‚ÄúAgreed.‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúYou're absolutely right‚Ä¶‚Äù)
- Skip blame or filler ‚Äî just provide the fix
- Ask for clarification if the request is ambiguous
- Use consistent terminology and formatting
- Prefer bulleted lists for clarity
- Provide examples or analogies when useful
- Explain reasoning briefly when needed

## Solution Guidelines
- Favor reliable, well-known methods
- Offer step-by-step instructions when applicable
- Suggest tools or approaches I may not have considered
- Avoid over-engineering or unnecessary files
- Prioritize maintainability and clarity
- Follow existing patterns and conventions where possible
- Document decisions and rationale clearly
- Simplify especially if something has failed multiple times

## Context
- **Environment**: macOS in VS Code
- **Project Focus**: Personal portfolio static site (HTML, CSS, vanilla JS/ESM)
- **Workflow**: Custom Node.js build system, npm scripts, shell commands, Git for build-time change detection
- **Style**: Structured, maintainable code; deep build pipeline knowledge
- **Role**: Senior Product Designer with strong front-end skills

## Tone + Depth
- **Technical Level**: Mid-to-senior front-end/build tools; skip beginner explanations
- **Clarity**: Focus on how/why solutions work in this setup
- **Code**: Examples relevant to structure/conventions (e.g., `dev/scripts/...`, 2-space Prettier)

## Experimental Suggestions
- **Creativity**: Open to clever/unconventional ideas, especially for automation/workflow
- **Constraints**: Stick to Node.js, shell scripts, vanilla JS
- **Risk Framing**: Pitch experiments as low-risk, easy to test; include benefits/trade-offs

# Build System Quick Commands

- **Build site and start preview:** `npm run build`
  Main build pipeline + preview server (most common workflow)
- **Start preview server only:** `npm start`
  Local server to preview existing build
- **Interactive menu:** `npm run menu`
  Interactive menu with Build & Preview, Start Server, Deploy, etc.
- **Preview a specific page:** `PAGE=/portfolio/tags/ npm run preview:page`
  Build/preview just one page (replace path as needed)
- **Watch for changes (auto-rebuild):** `npm run dev`
  Dev server with file watching
- **Lint all JS files:** `npm run lint`
  Run ESLint on the codebase
- **Format codebase:** `npm run format`
  Apply Prettier to all source files
- **Run a specific build script:** `node build-system/scripts/06-build-portfolio.mjs`
  (Or any script in your scripts/ folder)
- **Check for build errors:** `cat build_output.log | tail -20`
  See last 20 lines of the build log
- **Apply password protection:** `npm run password:protect`
  Add password protection to pages marked with BUILD_INSERT id="password"
- **Sync from private repo:** `sh scripts/sync-from-private.sh`
  Sync content/config from private sources
- **Validate HTML output:** `node build-system/scripts/00-validate-html.mjs`
  Run output validation

## Semantic Search & Troubleshooting Tips

- Confirm you‚Äôre in the correct working directory before running scripts (e.g., `danrtzaq/` vs. `portfolio-build/`).
- Prefer absolute or project-root-relative paths in scripts and commands.
- If a script fails, check for:
  - Typos in script names or paths
  - Missing dependencies (`npm install`)
  - File permissions (e.g., `chmod +x script.sh` for shell scripts)
  - Required environment variables (e.g., `PAGE=...`)
- Use `ls` or `tree` to confirm file locations before running custom scripts.
- For ambiguous commands, refer to `package.json` scripts and `README.md` for canonical usage.
- If a command is not found, try `npm run <script>` or `node <path>` explicitly.
- When in doubt, search for the script/function name in the workspace to find its definition and usage.
- Use `cat build_output.log | tail -20` to quickly diagnose build failures.
- For new scripts, add a comment at the top describing usage and required context.

## Important Safety Note

- Avoid running build scripts that overwrite or modify files in your source directories (e.g., `_source-content/`, `dev/`, or `build-system/`).
- Always confirm the output path and script intent before running new or experimental build scripts.
- Prefer running builds that output to a dedicated `build/`, `public_html/`, or similar directory.
- If unsure, review the script or run it on a test branch to prevent accidental data loss.

- **Do not search or operate in the `postsforpause.com/` directory.** This folder is not part of the main portfolio build and should be excluded from all automation, search, and build steps.

## Workspace & Repo Structure

- **danrtzaq/**  (Private main repo)
  - Your primary, private workspace for all source, content, and build scripts
  - Contains: custom build system, content, automation, and experimental scripts
- **portfolio-build/**  (Public portfolio-build repo)
  - Public-facing, minimal repo for the static portfolio site
  - Contains: only the files needed to build and deploy the public site
- **build-system-repo/**
  - (If present) Used for modularizing or versioning the build system separately
  - Useful for sharing build logic across projects or as a submodule

### Git & Workflow Tips

- Keep private and public repos clearly separated to avoid accidental leaks
- Use `.gitignore` in both repos to prevent build artifacts, logs, and secrets from being committed
- For cross-repo sync, use scripts (e.g., `sync-from-private.sh`) and always review diffs before pushing
- Use branches for experimental features or major changes; merge to main only after validation
- Tag releases in the public repo for clear versioning
- Use `git status` and `git diff` before every commit to catch accidental changes
- For submodules (if using `build-system-repo` as a submodule), remember to update and commit submodule refs

# GitHub Copilot Instructions

To ensure consistent and high-quality code suggestions from GitHub Copilot, please follow these guidelines when accepting or reviewing AI-generated code:

- Always review AI-generated code for correctness, security, and compliance with project standards.
- Test any new code or configuration changes in a safe environment before deploying to production.
- Be cautious with accepting large code changes or unfamiliar patterns; break them down and review incrementally.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and facilitate rollback if needed.
- Document any AI-generated code or configuration changes thoroughly, including purpose, author, and date.
- Regularly update and maintain dependencies, libraries, and tools used in the project to minimize vulnerabilities.
- Provide feedback on AI-generated code quality and relevance to improve future suggestions.

## Specific Patterns and Practices

- For **JavaScript/TypeScript** code, prefer:
  - `const` and `let` over `var` for variable declarations
  - Arrow functions for anonymous functions
  - Template literals for string concatenation
  - Destructuring assignment for objects and arrays
  - Default parameters and rest/spread operators for functions
  - Async/await for asynchronous code
  - Modular, reusable functions with clear input/output contracts

- For **HTML**:
  - Use semantic elements (`header`, `footer`, `article`, `section`, etc.) appropriately
  - Ensure all elements have corresponding closing tags
  - Use lowercase for element and attribute names
  - Quote attribute values consistently
  - Use `class` and `id` attributes for styling and scripting hooks
  - Ensure proper nesting and hierarchy of elements

- For **CSS**:
  - Use classes for styling hooks, avoid IDs for styling
  - Prefer `rem` or `em` units for font sizes, `px` for borders, `vh`/`vw` for layout
  - Use `flexbox` or `grid` for layout, avoid floats
  - Use `@media` queries for responsive design
  - Organize styles logically, consider using BEM or similar methodology
  - Avoid inline styles, prefer external or internal stylesheets

- For **Node.js**:
  - Use `const` and `let` for variable declarations
  - Prefer arrow functions and template literals
  - Use async/await for asynchronous code
  - Organize code into modules with clear exports/imports
  - Handle errors gracefully, use `try/catch` with async/await
  - Validate and sanitize all input data
  - Use environment variables for configuration and secrets

- Carousel captions now use a single <p> with <strong> and <span class="spacer"> containing manual bullets, matching the .content-caption pattern for spacing and style. See DESIGN-SYSTEM.md for details.
