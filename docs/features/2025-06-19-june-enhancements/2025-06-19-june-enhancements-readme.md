## ðŸš€ Unified Audit Workflow (June 20, 2025)

**Major audit workflow simplification is now complete!**

- All audit-related scripts have been consolidated into a single, user-friendly system: `audit.mjs`.
- Legacy scripts (`audit-site.mjs`, `compare-audits.mjs`, `update-audit-baseline.mjs`, `smart-audit.mjs`, `quick-build-audit.mjs`) have been removed or replaced.
- The interactive menu and all npm scripts now use only the new unified audit system.
- Audit output is concise, visually clear, and only shows recommendations if needed.
- All documentation and enhancement logs have been updated to reflect the new workflow.

**Key usage:**
```bash
node audit.mjs                # Smart audit with recommendations
node audit.mjs --build        # Build + audit
node audit.mjs --compare      # Compare last 3 audits
node audit.mjs --update-baseline  # Update baseline with confirmation
```

See below for details and migration notes.
