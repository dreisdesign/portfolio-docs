# Protected Portfolio Pages

## ✅ Implementation Complete

**What was implemented:**
- **BUILD_INSERT Integration**: Password protection using `<!-- BUILD_INSERT id="password" data-password="access-code" -->` markers
- **Professional UI**: Clean access form with hiring manager instructions and error handling
- **HTML Entity Preservation**: Enhanced encoding/decoding to ensure carousel arrows and complex JavaScript work correctly
- **Build Pipeline Integration**: Added `password:protect` npm script and build step after all BUILD_INSERT processing
- **Security Features**: Client-side password hashing, Base64 content encoding, anti-scraping protections

**Usage:**
1. Add `<!-- BUILD_INSERT id="password" data-password="your-access-code" -->` to any portfolio page
2. Run `npm run build` - password protection is automatically applied during build
3. Share protected URL with hiring managers along with access code

**Files Created:**
- `dev/scripts/password-protection/inject-password-protection.mjs` - Main protection script
- Added `password:protect` npm script to package.json
- Integrated into build.mjs pipeline

# Protected Portfolio Pages

**Status:** ✅ **Implemented & Deployed**
**Type:** Security/Privacy Feature
**Implementation:** BUILD_INSERT-based password protection integrated with build pipeline

## Overview

Create password-protected portfolio pages for confidential design work (unreleased products) that need to be shared with hiring managers while avoiding web scraping and search indexing.

## Requirements

- Share confidential design screenshots with hiring managers
- Prevent Google indexing and casual scraping
- No third-party services (Cloudflare, etc.)
- Use existing hosting setup (Namecheap)
- Simple implementation that integrates with current build system

## Solution: Obscured Path + Password Protection

### Directory Structure
```
build/
├── portfolio/
├── about/
└── a7f3kx2-portfolio/          # Random obscured directory
    ├── confidential.html       # Protected page
    └── assets/
        ├── image1.jpg
        ├── image2.jpg
        └── ...
```

### Features

1. **Base64 Image Encoding**: Images embedded directly in HTML to prevent direct URL access
2. **Simple Password Protection**: JavaScript-based access control with obfuscated password
3. **Anti-Scraping Measures**:
   - `robots.txt` disallow rules
   - No-index meta tags
   - Right-click prevention
   - Context menu blocking
4. **Professional Presentation**: Clean UI with hiring manager instructions

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Build Script Creation
- Create `dev/scripts/generate-protected-portfolio.mjs`
- Script converts image directory + password into protected HTML page
- Base64 encodes all images to prevent direct access
- Generates random directory name for obscurity

#### Phase 2: Build System Integration
- Add npm script: `npm run portfolio:protect`
- Integrate with existing build pipeline
- Add to `.gitignore` to keep passwords out of repo

#### Phase 3: Deployment Automation
- Generate protected pages during build process
- Copy to random directory in build output
- Update robots.txt to exclude protected directories

### Usage Workflow

1. **Create protected page:**
   ```bash
   npm run portfolio:protect path/to/screenshots/ "access-code-123" confidential-work
   ```

2. **Build generates:**
   - Random directory: `build/a7f3kx2-portfolio/`
   - Protected HTML file with embedded images
   - Updated robots.txt with disallow rules

3. **Share with hiring managers:**
   - URL: `yoursite.com/a7f3kx2-portfolio/confidential.html`
   - Access code: "access-code-123"
   - Include instructions in email signature

### Security Layers

- **Obscurity**: Random directory names
- **Password Protection**: Required for content access
- **Image Encoding**: No direct image URLs
- **Search Prevention**: robots.txt + meta tags
- **Right-click Blocking**: Prevents casual downloading

### File Structure

```
dev/scripts/
└── generate-protected-portfolio.mjs    # Main generator script

DOCS/FEATURES/
└── protected-portfolio-pages.md        # This documentation

package.json                            # Added npm scripts
robots.txt                              # Updated with disallow rules
```

### npm Scripts to Add

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "portfolio:protect": "node dev/scripts/generate-protected-portfolio.mjs",
    "portfolio:confidential": "npm run portfolio:protect confidential-designs/ your-access-code confidential-work"
  }
}
```

### Example Protected Page Features

- Professional access form with hiring manager instructions
- Clean, modern UI matching site design
- Embedded images with proper presentation
- Disclaimer about confidential nature
- Contact information for access code requests

## Benefits

- ✅ No hosting changes required
- ✅ No SSL complications
- ✅ Integrates with existing build system
- ✅ Professional presentation for hiring managers
- ✅ Deters casual scraping and search indexing
- ✅ Simple to implement and maintain

## Next Steps

1. Create the generator script
2. Add npm scripts to package.json
3. Test with sample images
4. Update robots.txt template
5. Document usage in README

**Note:** This provides reasonable protection for portfolio purposes while acknowledging that determined users can still bypass client-side security. The goal is professional presentation + deterring casual access.
