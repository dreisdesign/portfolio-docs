# Feature: "New" Badge for Recently Added Pages

**Date:** 2025-08-15

## Overview
Show a "NEW" badge on new pages or cards, which disappears for a user after they visit the page (per browser, using localStorage).

---

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Mark New Pages in HTML
Add a badge element to new pages or cards:
```html
<span class="badge-new" id="new-badge">NEW</span>
```
Or, for cards/links to new pages, add the badge to those elements.

---

### 2. JavaScript: Hide Badge After First Visit
Add this script to the page or your main JS bundle:
```js
(function() {
  const pageKey = 'visited_' + window.location.pathname;
  const badge = document.getElementById('new-badge');
  if (!badge) return;

  if (localStorage.getItem(pageKey)) {
    badge.style.display = 'none';
  } else {
    // Mark as visited when the page is loaded
    localStorage.setItem(pageKey, '1');
  }
})();
```
- The badge shows for first-time visitors.
- Once loaded, the badge is hidden on all future visits (for that user/browser).

---

### 3. CSS for the Badge
```css
.badge-new {
  background: #ff0;
  color: #333;
  font-weight: bold;
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 2px 8px;
  margin-left: 8px;
  font-size: 0.75rem;
}
```

---

### 4. For Cards/Links to New Pages
- Use a unique key for each page (e.g., `visited_/portfolio/new-project/`).
- When rendering cards, check localStorage for that key and hide the badge if present.

---

## Notes
- This is privacy-friendly, works per user/browser, and requires no backend.
- Remove the badge from the HTML or build system after the page is no longer considered "new."

---

## Example Use Cases
- Portfolio cards for new projects
- Blog post links
- Feature announcements
